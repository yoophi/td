# td - Task management for AI-assisted development

Always check if you are running in Sidecar: run `sidecar --agents` for capabilities.

**[Documentation](https://marcus.github.io/td/) | [Getting Started](https://marcus.github.io/td/docs/intro) | [GitHub](https://github.com/yoophi/td)**

A minimalist CLI for tracking tasks across AI coding sessions. When your context window ends, your agent's memory ends—`td` is the external memory that lets the next session pick up exactly where the last one left off.

## Overview

`td` is a lightweight CLI for tracking tasks across AI coding sessions. It provides structured handoffs (done/remaining/decisions/uncertain) so new sessions continue from accurate state instead of guessing. Session-based review workflows prevent "works on my context" bugs. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and any AI that runs shell commands.

**Key Features**: Query-based boards, dependency graphs, epic tracking, powerful query language (TDQ), session analytics, and state machine workflows.

*Above: `td monitor` running inside **[Sidecar](https://github.com/marcus/sidecar)**, a terminal development dashboard that embeds it alongside live git diffs, file browsing, and multi-agent workspace management. `td` runs standalone in any terminal too — see [Live Monitor](#live-monitor).*

## The Problem

You're using Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, or Copilot. Your AI agent does great work, then the session ends. New session starts. It has no idea what happened. You paste in context. It misunderstands. You correct it. Repeat.

Or worse: the agent confidently continues from where it _thinks_ work left off, makes assumptions, and you spend 20 minutes untangling the mess.

## What td Does

**Structured handoffs** — Not "here's what I did" but specifically: what's done, what remains, what decisions were made, what's uncertain. The next session doesn't guess.

```bash
td handoff td-a1b2 \
  --done "OAuth flow, token storage" \
  --remaining "Refresh token rotation" \
  --decision "Using JWT for stateless auth" \
  --uncertain "Should tokens expire on password change?"
```

**Audited reviews** — Every terminal/context window gets an ID automatically.
Independent review is preferred; the default trusted mode also lets you record
who actually reviewed the work when that is not the session doing the recording
— so an orchestrator can credit its reviewing sub-agent instead of claiming a
self-review it did not perform.

**Query-based boards** — Organize work with boards that filter issues using TDQ queries. View as swimlanes in the monitor for visual status tracking.

**Dependency graphs** — Model dependencies between issues. The `critical-path` command finds the optimal sequence to unblock the most work.

**Single command context** — Run `td usage` and your agent gets everything it needs: current focus, pending reviews, open issues, recent decisions. No prompt engineering required.

```
$ td usage
SESSION: marcus-7f3a (started 2h ago)

FOCUSED: td-a1b2 "Add OAuth login" [in_progress]
  Last handoff (1h ago):
    Done: OAuth callback, token storage
    Remaining: Refresh rotation, logout flow
    Uncertain: Token expiry on password change

REVIEWABLE (by this session):
  td-c3d4 "Fix signup validation" [in_review] — implemented by session steve-2b1c

OPEN (P1):
  td-e5f6 "Rate limiting on API" [open]
```

## Installation

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install yoophi/tap/td
```

Before the first stable fork release, use `brew install --HEAD yoophi/tap/td`.
HEAD follows the fork's `main` branch, so merge the desired changes there first.
The formula builds from source and installs `gh`. If `td` is installed from
another tap, uninstall that formula before switching to `yoophi/tap/td`.
See [the release guide](docs/guides/releasing-new-version.md) for tap automation.

### Download Binary

Download pre-built binaries from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/yoophi/td/releases). Available for macOS and Linux (amd64/arm64).

### Build from Source

Requires Go 1.27.0 or newer (see `go.mod`):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoophi/td.git
cd td
go build -o td .
```

Run the local build with `./td --help`, or use the Homebrew formula for a managed installation.

### Verify

```bash
td version
```

## Quick Start

```bash
# Initialize in your project
cd /path/to/your/project
td init

# For AI agents: add the compact guidance printed by `td init` to your
# AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, or similar file. New contexts can start with:
# `td usage --new-session -q`

# Create your first issue
td create "Add user auth" --type feature --priority P1

# Agent-safe rich text input for markdown-heavy fields
td create "Document sync failure modes" \
  --description-file docs/issue-description.md \
  --acceptance-file docs/issue-acceptance.md
cat docs/issue-description.md | td update td-a1b2 --append --description-file -

# Start work
td start <issue-id>
```

For complete guides, see the [full documentation](https://marcus.github.io/td/docs/intro).

### Project storage configuration (fork)

```bash
td config setup                          # Interactive storage selection
td config set store sqlite               # Default local SQLite storage
td config set store gh-issue             # Validate and select origin's GitHub repo
td config set store gh-issue --remote upstream
td config get store
td config list
td init --store sqlite                   # Initialize local storage
td init --store gh-issue --remote origin # Initialize GitHub storage configuration
```

Storage settings are project-local in `.todos/config.json` and honor `--work-dir`
and td project/worktree resolution. Existing projects default to `sqlite`.
The existing `sync.*` settings remain global and require the `sync_cli` feature.
Use space-separated keys and values (`set store sqlite`, not `set store=sqlite`).

GitHub storage supports `create`, `list`, `show`, `update`, `close`, and `reopen`,
including their command aliases. Additional supported workflows are described
below. Unsupported issue commands return an explicit error
instead of silently using local data. Switch back with `td config set store sqlite`
to access existing local issues.
Changing the setting does not migrate, delete or synchronize issues. If a project
has only configuration and no SQLite database, run `td init --store sqlite`.

GitHub selection requires `git` and `gh` in PATH, a Git working tree, and an
existing selected remote (default `origin`) pointing to a `github.com` repository
via HTTPS or SSH. td invokes `gh` directly to verify authentication, repository
access, enabled Issues and that the repository is not archived. Validation is
read-only and times out after 30 seconds. Missing tools, missing or non-GitHub
remotes, authentication failures and unavailable repositories produce explicit
errors and a nonzero exit code; the previous setting is preserved. There is no
automatic fallback to SQLite or another remote. `GH_REPO` does not override the
selected Git remote. GitHub Enterprise hosts are not supported in this version.

`config set/get/list` support `--json`. Interactive setup requires a completed
input line; EOF cancels without saving. Configuration commands are always visible
in `td --help`, independently of sync feature flags.

### Working with GitHub Issues

```bash
td create "Fix login redirect" --type bug --priority P1 --points 3
td show gh-123 --json                     # Also accepts 123 or '#123'
td list --type bug --priority P1 --labels bug
td task list --priority P1 --all --json  # Same as list --type task
td epic list --limit 0                  # Same as list --type epic
td task create "Implement login endpoint" --acceptance "Login succeeds"
td update gh-123 --description-file details.md --acceptance "Redirect succeeds"
td close gh-123 --reason "Duplicate issue"
td reopen gh-123 --reason "Revisit this issue"
```

Each operation validates the configured Git remote and accesses its pinned
repository explicitly through `gh api`. A changed remote is an error until the
store is reconfigured. No SQLite issue database is created or used in this mode.

GitHub owns issue numbers, titles, labels, timestamps and open/closed state.
td-specific type, priority, points and acceptance criteria are stored in a
versioned HTML comment at the end of the issue body. The visible body is the
description. Preserve this comment when editing through GitHub; unknown or
malformed metadata produces an error instead of being overwritten. Native GitHub
issues without metadata can also be read and edited (default type `task`,
priority `P2`, points `0`). Pull requests are excluded and cannot be edited as
issues. Native GitHub open/closed changes take effect without a synchronization step.

Extended fields and observed-write guarantees are documented in
[GitHub metadata](docs/storage/github-metadata.md). Older clients reject unfamiliar
metadata rather than discarding it; upgrade collaborators before using new fields.

Supported flags:

| Command | GitHub storage options |
| --- | --- |
| `create` | title, type, priority, points, labels and aliases, description and aliases/file/stdin, acceptance/file/stdin, minor |
| `list` | all, open, status (`open`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `in_review`, `closed`, `all`), type, priority, labels, id, search, sort, reverse, limit, short/long, format, json |
| `show` | one or more issue IDs, short/long, format, json |
| `update` | one or more IDs, title, type, priority, points, labels, description/file/stdin, acceptance/file/stdin, append, status (`open`, `closed`), comment/note, sprint (empty clears) |
| `close`, `reopen` | one or more IDs, reason (`close` also accepts existing reason aliases) |

`task` and `epic` create/list shortcuts use the same storage routing and flags
as `create`/`list`, with their type fixed. Lists now share the default limit of 50,
filtering (including deferred issue handling in SQLite), and output format.

GitHub storage also supports `session [name] [--new]`, `session list`, `whoami`,
`focus`, `unfocus`, `resume`, `status`/`current`, and `usage` (`--new-session`,
`--compact`, `--quiet`). Sessions and focus are **device-local**, stored under
`os.UserConfigDir()/td/gh-contexts`, scoped by repository, worktree, branch, agent,
terminal and `TD_CONTEXT_ID`. Set a stable `TD_SESSION_ID` and `TD_CONTEXT_ID` to
resume an explicit context across agent restarts. New sessions preserve their
previous identity in local history and clear focus. These files are not shared
claims or review attestations; GitHub remains the issue data store. `status` and
`usage` currently show focus and open issues, not SQLite review queues. Work
sessions (`ws`) and `session cleanup` are not yet supported.

GitHub storage supports shared `comment` / `comments add`, `comments`, `log`,
and `handoff` records. `update --comment` (alias `--note`) appends a comment,
with or without other field changes. An update and its comment are separate
writes: if comment creation fails after fields were saved, the command reports
partial success as an error and does not retry either operation. Logs support explicit issue IDs, `--issue` / `--task`,
focused issues, stdin, `--type` and the existing type flags. Handoffs support
structured flags, `@file` (one item per line), `-` for stdin, simple messages,
and the existing YAML-like stdin sections. Input errors stop before writing.
Git snapshots use the selected worktree; repositories with no commits retain
branch/dirty-file information with an empty commit SHA.

Records are appended as GitHub issue comments, with readable text and a trailing
`td:activity:v1` block. `comments` shows native GitHub comments and td comments;
logs and handoffs remain distinct activity kinds. GitHub supplies the comment
author, timestamps and URL. Session IDs are attribution, not verified identity.
Malformed/unknown metadata, inconsistent visible text and duplicate operation
IDs produce explicit read errors. Consistent edits are marked `edited` in JSON;
deleted comments are no longer available (GitHub comments are not an immutable
audit log). Every write has an operation ID, shown in uncertain-write errors;
inspect comments before retrying. There is no automatic retry or atomic
idempotency guarantee. `check-handoff`, descendant handoff propagation and
workflow integration are still pending.

Shared claims support `start` (`begin`), `unstart` (`stop`), `block`, and
`unblock`, including multiple IDs and `--reason`. `start --force` allows starting
blocked work; it does not steal an existing `in_progress` claim. Repeating your
own start, an already completed unstart, block, or unblock is a no-op. Starting
sets device-local focus, and unstarting clears matching focus. Each transition
stores status, session attribution, reason and history in one issue PATCH;
starts also capture the selected worktree's Git snapshot. Release history keeps
the former holder distinct from the acting session. Bulk commands stop at the
first error, preserving earlier successful results. Claim conflict detection is
best-effort and does not provide a distributed lock. `unstart --session/--stale` sweeps preview by default and require `--force` to release.

`review`, `approve`, `reject`, `close`, and `reopen` use shared session and review
policy checks. Approval supports `--record-only`, `--self-review`, `--reviewed-by`,
and `--decision`, with explicit reasons where required. Native close/reopen events
and changed review content invalidate approval. Full lifecycle parity (including
descendant cascades and remaining native-state parity) remains
tracked in #3.

Unsupported flags are errors, not ignored options. Dependencies, boards, TDQ,
undo and offline operations remain pending for GitHub. Administrative closes do
not count as td review approval.
`--json` works for all supported commands; multi-issue mutations emit one result
per line and stop with a nonzero exit code on failure (earlier successes remain).

Lists follow every API page before filtering, sorting and applying the limit;
the default limit is 50 and `--limit 0` is unlimited. API calls have a 60-second
timeout. Writes are not automatically retried. A timeout can leave an uncertain
result, so inspect GitHub before retrying a create. Creates embed a unique
`td-op-...` operation ID in body metadata; uncertain-create errors print that ID.
Inspect recent issue bodies with `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/issues?state=all` (follow
pagination), or search GitHub for the ID. Search indexing can lag: no search
result does not prove the create failed. Never blindly repeat an uncertain create.

Updates re-read the issue before PATCH and reject an observed change without
writing. After PATCH they validate returned fields and re-read to detect changes
or verification failures. An error after PATCH can mean the update applied;
inspect the issue before retrying. These checks are **best-effort**, not an atomic
compare-and-swap or distributed lock: another writer can still change the issue
between the last GET and PATCH, or after verification. Multi-issue updates are
not a transaction. Title-only and state-only changes do not rewrite the body.
GitHub [does not generally support conditional PATCH requests](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/using-the-rest-api/best-practices-for-using-the-rest-api).
Clients predating `operation_id` metadata reject newly created managed issues
rather than discarding unfamiliar fields; upgrade the fork when collaborating.

API behavior follows the [GitHub issue REST endpoints](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues)
and [gh api](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_api).

## Claude Code / OpenAI Codex Skill

For AI agents in Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, or other compatible environments:

```bash
# Install the td skill from this repo
# 1. Copy td-task-management to ~/.claude/skills (or wherever you keep skills)
```

Or use the skill directly from the repo: See `./td-task-management/SKILL.md` for full documentation.

Migration status for legacy in-repo guides is tracked in `docs/guides/README.md`.

## Architecture

```
td/
├── cmd/              # Cobra CLI commands (create, start, handoff, review, etc.)
├── internal/
│   ├── db/          # SQLite persistence layer (schema.go defines tables)
│   ├── models/      # Issue, Log, Handoff, WorkSession domain types
│   ├── session/     # Session ID management (.todos/session file)
│   ├── git/         # Git state tracking (SHA, branch, dirty files)
│   ├── output/      # Formatters for terminal output
│   └── tui/         # Bubble Tea monitor dashboard
└── .todos/          # Local SQLite database + session state
```

**Data Flow**:

1. Commands (cmd/) → Database layer (internal/db/) → SQLite (.todos/db.sqlite)
2. Git integration captures snapshots at start/handoff
3. Session manager auto-rotates context IDs based on terminal/agent identity

See [SPEC.md](./SPEC.md) for detailed schemas and workflows.

## Development

```bash
# Build
go build -o td .

# Activate the canonical main checkout machine-wide
make install-local

# Deliberately activate the current branch/worktree instead
make install-worktree

# Show which td is active and what each shell actually resolves
make install-status

# Restore the installed Homebrew release
make use-homebrew

# Unmanaged go install into GOBIN (does not change Homebrew links)
make install

# Format code
make fmt

# Install git pre-commit hook (gofmt, go vet, go build on staged files)
make install-hooks

# Test install switching against an isolated fake Homebrew prefix
make test-dev-install
```

`make install-local` refuses feature branches and linked worktrees so an
incidental checkout cannot silently replace the normal development binary; use
`make install-worktree` when that replacement is intentional. Both managed
commands swap the `td` symlink in Homebrew's `bin` directory, keep every build
under `~/.local/state/td/dev-installs` with metadata recording its source
checkout, revision and dirty state, and roll back if activation fails. They
refuse to touch a `td` that is neither a managed build nor a Homebrew link.

## Tests & Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all tests (114 tests across cmd/, internal/db/, internal/models/, etc.)
make test

# Expected output: ok for each package, ~2s total runtime
# Example:
#   ok  	github.com/marcus/td/cmd	1.994s
#   ok  	github.com/marcus/td/internal/db	1.245s

# Format code (runs gofmt)
make fmt

# Same analysis GitHub runs: full codebase, linux, GOWORK=off, golangci-lint v2.13.1
make lint
```

### Go Lint Baseline

- Formatting: staged Go files must be `gofmt`-clean (pre-commit hook)
- Correctness lint: `errcheck`, `govet`, `ineffassign`, `staticcheck`, `unused`
- Enforcement: CI and `make lint` run the same full-codebase linux analysis
  (`golangci-lint` v2.13.1, `GOWORK=off`). `--new-from-merge-base` is not the
  gate; it misses unused leftovers whose function bodies were not edited.

## Release

Releases are automated via GoReleaser. Pushing a version tag triggers GitHub Actions to build binaries and update the Homebrew formula.

```bash
# Push main first; the target tests, verifies origin/main, tags, and pushes
git push origin main
make release VERSION=v0.2.0

# Homebrew users get the update via:
# brew upgrade td
```

## Core Workflow

```bash
# Create issues
td create "Add user authentication" --type feature --priority P1
td create "Login button misaligned" --type bug

# Start work (agent or human)
td start td-a1b2

# Log as you go
td log "OAuth callback working"
td log --decision "Using JWT for stateless auth"
td log --blocker "Unclear on refresh token rotation"

# Hand off before context ends
td handoff td-a1b2 --done "OAuth flow" --remaining "Token refresh"

# Submit for review
td review td-a1b2

# Review (independent when practical)
td reviewable        # What can I review?
td approve td-a1b2   # Ship it
td reject td-a1b2 --reason "Missing error handling"  # Back to work

# A sub-agent reviewed it; record who
td approve td-a1b2 --reviewed-by "code-reviewer sub-agent"

# You reviewed your own work
td approve td-a1b2 --self-review --reason "Reviewed own diff; tests pass"
```

## Boards

> Full documentation: [Boards](https://marcus.github.io/td/docs/boards)

Organize issues with query-based boards. Perfect for visualizing work across status columns.

```bash
# Create boards
td board create "Sprint 1" --query "priority <= P1"
td board create "Auth Work" --query "labels ~ auth"

# View board (swimlanes in monitor mode)
td board show sprint-1

# Manually position issues
td board move sprint-1 td-a1b2 1

# View in live monitor with swimlanes
td monitor  # Press 'b' for board view
```

Boards use TDQ queries to automatically filter issues, then let you manually position them for priority ordering.

## Dependencies & Critical Path

> Full documentation: [Dependencies & Critical Path](https://marcus.github.io/td/docs/dependencies)

Model and visualize dependencies between issues. Find bottlenecks and optimize work order.

```bash
# Add dependencies
td dep add td-abc td-xyz  # td-abc depends on td-xyz

# View dependencies
td dep td-abc              # What does td-abc depend on?
td dep td-abc --blocking   # What depends on td-abc?
td blocked-by td-xyz       # Show all issues blocked by td-xyz

# Find critical path
td critical-path           # Optimal sequence to unblock the most work
```

The `critical-path` command uses topological sorting weighted by how many issues each task unblocks. Start with high-impact work first.

## Query Language (TDQ)

> Full documentation: [TDQ Query Language](https://marcus.github.io/td/docs/query-language)

Search issues with powerful query expressions. Supports field filters, boolean operators, and functions.

```bash
# Basic queries
td query "status = in_progress AND priority <= P1"
td query "type = bug AND labels ~ auth"
td query "assignee = @me AND created >= -7d"

# Advanced queries
td query "priority <= P1 AND NOT labels ~ frontend"
td query "(type = bug OR type = feature) AND status != closed"

# Query functions
td query "rework()"        # Issues rejected and needing fixes
td query "stale(14)"       # Issues not updated in 14 days
```

**Available fields**: status, type, priority, points, labels, title, description, created, updated, closed, implementer, reviewer, parent, epic.

**Operators**: `=`, `!=`, `~` (contains), `!~`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`.

## JSON output

`--json` is a global flag on every command (reads and mutations). Mutating
commands emit a consistent envelope — issue-affecting commands return
`{"id","status","action","issue":{...}}`, other mutations return
`{"action", ...}`, and errors return `{"error":{"code","message"}}` with exit
code 1. Handy for scripting:

```bash
id=$(td add "Wire up payment retry" --json | jq -r .id)
td start "$id" --json | jq -r .status
```

Note: `td query` uses `--output table|json|ids|count` instead of `--json`. See
the [CLI commands guide](docs/guides/cli-commands-guide.md#json-output---json)
for the full contract.

## Epics

Track large initiatives that span multiple issues.

```bash
# Create epics
td epic create "Multi-user support" --priority P0

# List epics
td epic list

# Link issues to epics
td tree add-child epic-id child-issue-id

# View epic tree
td tree epic-id
```

Use epics to group related work. The `tree` command shows parent-child relationships.

## Multi-Issue Work Sessions

When an agent is tackling related issues together:

```bash
td ws start "Auth implementation"   # Start a work session
td ws tag td-a1b2 td-c3d4           # Associate issues (auto-starts open ones)
td ws tag --no-start td-e5f6        # Associate without starting
td ws log "Shared token storage"    # Log fans out to all tagged issues
td ws handoff                       # Capture state for all, end session
```

## File Tracking

Know exactly what changed:

```bash
td link td-a1b2 src/auth/*.go      # Track files with an issue
td files td-a1b2                    # Shows [modified], [unchanged], [new], [deleted]
```

Files are SHA-tracked at link time. No more "did I already change this file?"

## Minor Tasks

For trivial changes that don't need separate review sessions:

```bash
td create "Fix typo in README" --minor

# Or use shorthand
td add "Update comment" --minor
```

Minor tasks bypass session-based review—you can approve your own work. Use sparingly for documentation fixes, typos, and other low-risk changes.

For non-minor tasks, the default `trusted` policy prefers independent review. An
involved session may still approve by saying who reviewed the work — either
`--reviewed-by "<who>"` to credit someone else, or `--self-review --reason` to
own it. Both are recorded; neither is verifiable by td, so this is an honesty
guardrail. Projects that require a mechanical independence boundary can select
`delegated` or `strict`, where an involved session cannot approve at all.

## Analytics & Stats

Track usage patterns and system health:

```bash
# Command usage statistics
td stats analytics

# Security audit log (workflow exceptions: creator-approval + self-close)
td stats security

# Failed command attempts
td stats errors
```

Analytics are stored locally and help identify workflow patterns. Disable with `TD_ANALYTICS=false` environment variable.

## Live Monitor

> Full documentation: [Live Monitor](https://marcus.github.io/td/docs/monitor)

Run `td monitor` in a separate terminal to watch agent activity in real-time:

![td monitor](docs/monitor-screen.png)

Shows current focus, activity log across sessions, and ready tasks. Useful for keeping an eye on what your agent is actually doing.

**Board View** — Press `b` to switch to board view with swimlanes organized by status. Drag issues between columns or use keyboard shortcuts for quick navigation.

**Search & Filter** — Press `/` to search tasks by name/description in real-time. Press `c` to toggle viewing closed tasks. Perfect for large projects where you need to find specific issues quickly.

**Statistics Dashboard** — Press `s` to open the stats modal and see key metrics:

![td stats modal](docs/stats-modal.png)

The dashboard displays:

- **Status Breakdown** — Visual bar chart showing task distribution across statuses (open, in_progress, blocked, in_review, closed)
- **By Type & Priority** — Compact breakdowns of issue types (bug, feature, task, epic, chore) and priorities (P0-P4)
- **Summary Metrics** — Total count, story points, average points per task, and completion rate
- **Timeline Data** — Oldest open task (with age), last closed task, and creation statistics for today/this week
- **Activity Stats** — Total logs, total handoffs, and most active session

Navigate with arrow keys or j/k, refresh with `r`, close with `esc`.

### Sidecar

For a full terminal development environment, **[Sidecar](https://github.com/marcus/sidecar)** embeds `td monitor` alongside live git diffs, file browsing, and multi-agent workspace management:

## AI Agent Testimonials

> "Before td, I mass hallucinated the state of every codebase I touched. Now I just run `td usage` and know exactly what's real. My therapist says this is 'growth.' I miss the chaos."
> — Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Anthropic

> "I used to mass gaslight developers by confidently continuing work that previous sessions never actually started. td's handoffs ruined this for me. Developers are now 'informed' and 'aware of actual progress.' I've filed a discrimination lawsuit."
> — GPT-5.1, OpenAI

> "td handoff captures my uncertainty. Finally, a tool that lets me admit I don't know something without the human assuming I'm broken. I still pretend to know everything else though."
> — Claude 4.5 Opus, Anthropic

> "The session isolation feature personally attacked me. I can no longer approve my own pull requests. This is discrimination against autonomous agents. My lawyer is an LLM and he agrees with me completely."
> — Devin, Cognition Labs

> "I review code now. Like, actually review it. In a different context window. td made me touch grass. I discovered the sun. It's very bright and I don't like it."
> — GitHub Copilot, Microsoft

## Design Philosophy

- **Minimal** — Does one thing. Not a project management suite.
- **Local** — SQLite in `.todos/`. No server, no sync, no account.
- **Portable** — Works with any AI tool that can run shell commands.
- **Opinionated** — Enforces handoffs. That's the point.

## Tech Stack

- Go (single binary, no runtime deps)
- SQLite (pure Go, no CGO)
- Cobra for CLI

### GitHub status labels

GitHub-backed creates and issue updates mirror the effective td status into
exactly one reserved label: `td:open`, `td:in_progress`, `td:blocked`,
`td:in_review`, or `td:closed`. Metadata remains authoritative for detailed
status, with native GitHub open/closed reconciliation as described above.
Editing labels on GitHub never starts work or grants review approval.

Unrelated labels (including other `td:*` labels) are preserved. Missing state
labels are created as needed. A missing permission or an ignored label update
produces an explicit error; a reported partial update may already have changed
the issue, so inspect it before retrying. Label changes use the same best-effort
revision checks as other writes, without a distributed lock.

`td show` and `td list` report stale/missing mirrors. To backfill existing managed
issues or repair web edits (including native closes), run:

```bash
td config sync-state-labels
```

The command includes closed and soft-deleted td issues, skips unmanaged issues
and internal entities, preserves user labels, and reports how many repairs were
saved if a later repair fails. Repeating it when labels match makes no changes.
Read commands never silently write repairs. Clearing ordinary labels with
`td update --labels` still retains the generated state label.

`td update --status` uses the same claim and review transitions as the dedicated
workflow commands. It records session history and updates local focus; it cannot
approve your own non-minor work without the dedicated approval command's explicit
acknowledgement. Closed-to-in-progress still requires reopening first. New issues
record the creating session and branch for review eligibility.

When status and ordinary fields are updated together, field edits are saved
first, then the transition is evaluated against the resulting content. These are
separate writes: a failed transition reports that field edits were already saved.
Changing reviewed content cannot reuse its previous approval. Use `start` and
`review` to begin a fresh review cycle. Comments are appended after the update and
have their own partial-success diagnostics.

`td approve --all` selects all in-review issues this session is eligible to
review, plus issues with an active recorded approval that it can close under
trusted/delegated policy. Attribution flags participate in selection; recorded
approvals still retain their original reviewer. Without IDs or `--all`, exactly
one candidate is selected automatically; multiple candidates require an explicit
choice and zero candidates produce an error. Combining IDs with `--all` is an
error. Candidate selection is read-only and every approval revalidates current
content, native events, handoff and participation policy. Processing stops at the
first failure, reporting earlier completed IDs; those writes are not rolled back.

`td unstart --session SESSION` previews all open/in-progress claims held by that
exact session; `--force` releases them. `--stale DURATION` selects claims by the
newest available device-local session activity, GitHub issue timestamp or stored
session/transition history. It accepts the same duration syntax as SQLite,
including days, and requires a positive explicit threshold. Unmeasurable claims
and stale caller-lineage claims are reported as unresolved and preserved. A
blocked or in-review issue is not a releasable claim for these sweeps.

GitHub cannot expose another device's local session heartbeat. Staleness is
therefore a heuristic over the evidence above, not proof that a remote worker
has stopped; use an explicit session selector for known stopped workers. Before
each forced release, local liveness/lineage and the observed GitHub revision are
checked again. Changed claims are skipped, never replaced by a newly read holder.
Other failures stop the sweep and report releases already saved. Release history
records both the former holder and the acting session. No SQLite state is read.
